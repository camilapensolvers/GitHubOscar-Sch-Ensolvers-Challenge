# Ensolvers challenge project NoteSolver
### By Oscar AndrÃ©s Schwerdt


In this application you will be creating and editing notes. You will be able to add tags to the notes and filter them by them. Also you will have the option of store notes in the archive or retrieving notes from there.

#### Deploying the App
Once you cloned this repository you would need to install **Docker** if you dont have it. You can download the latest version of **Docker Desktop** for a comfy GUI.
Now you can deploy it in your machine by positioning your **BASH** terminal in the root folder and type (for *MacOs* and *Linux*):

		./run_compose.sh`

Or if you are using Windows you can execute the .bat file instead, by typing this in your **CMD**:

		`./run_compose.bat`

This will create the images and containers required by docker compose, and then it will deploy the entire app using **Docker**, including the database.

If you face any problem running this files, you can simply code this in any terminal:

		`./docker-compose up`

#### Specifications

This App was contructed using:

	-Vue 3
	-Bootstrap 5
	-Java 11
	-SpringBoot 2.7
		_Spring Web
		_Spring Data JPA
	-Swagger 2.9.2
	-Docker 24.0.5
	-PostgreSQL

If you want to run the backend on development, like using maven plugin spring-boor.run, make sure to comment the postgre lines and uncomment the H2 ones. This is due that the Database its created and deployed by Docker. By using the H2 database instead you will be capable of running the project perfectly.


#### Disclaimer

Wasn't able to implement Login or any kind of user management due the lack of time.
Wasn't able to deploy the project on a hosting because I couldn't find any free viable option to do it so.
